The following are my notes on *Song of Solomon*, by Toni Morrison. These notes are subject to change in the future. 

## General Background Information



## Relevant Background Information

Toni Morrison was skeptical of the idea of muses. She felt it was the artist’s way to obfuscate their process, whether it be because they don’t understand their own art or because they fear others will copy it. I share that skepticism.

She wrote a beautiful description of her late father’s character and belief in her, and said he was her muse. This story came out of her in place of the usual rituals of grief. 

## Plot Summary
### Chapters

#### Chapter 1

We learn that an insurance agent committed suicide after promising to take a flight South. The note is pleasing and indicates his love for those he leaves behind. 

He asks for forgiveness.
