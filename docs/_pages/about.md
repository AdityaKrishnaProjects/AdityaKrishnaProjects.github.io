I am interested in finding pursuits where:
1. I can push myself and do things that I didn't think I was capable of. In essence: pursuits where trying your hardest matters and you often have more to give than you think
2. There is an aesthetic quality that I appreciate in the process of trying to master the pursuit
3. The pursuit becomes more interesting the more you invest in it

Thus far I have found that researching language, rock climbing, programming, and melee fit this criteria. Please reach out to me if you there is anything in your life which you feel fits this criteria which is not on my list.
