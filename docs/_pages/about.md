I am interested in finding pursuits where:
1. I can push myself and do things that I didn't think I was capable of, in essence, pursuits where trying your hardest matters and you often have more to give than you think
2. There is aesthetic quality that I appreciate in the process of trying to master the pursuit
3. The pursuit becomes more interesting the more you invest in it

Thus far I have found that researching language, rock climbing, programming, and melee fit this criteria. Please reach out to me if you identify any others.
